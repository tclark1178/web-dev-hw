1. I chose Times and serf to get the old time look of a newspaper at that time.
Fallback fonts are the fonts that load in place if your normal fonts don't. Web font are fonts
meant for the web while web safe font are the fonts available on you computer being ether Mac or Windows.

This was a assignment was a struggle as my CSS and font-family input wouldn't work
I had to keep resetting the whole page a few times just to get "Times" to work on my browser.
