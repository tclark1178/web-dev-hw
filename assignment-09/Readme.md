1. The universal selector is the * and it allows all of the html elements on a page to be styled. The element selector is used to select all of the elements of a certain type. The class selectors selects elements that have the same function. The ID selector will style rules for specific elements by using a unique ID like a # for example. All are helpful but some may be used over others like using the Universal to style everything instead of just one thing.
