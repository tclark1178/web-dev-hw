    <p>"William Butler Yeats (1865-1939)
    was born in Dublin into an Irish Protestant family.
    His father, John Butler Yeats,
    a clergyman's son, was a lawyer turned to an
    Irish Pre-Raphaelite painter.
    Yeats's mother, Susan Pollexfen,
    came from a wealthy family -
    the Pollexfens had a prosperous
    milling and shipping business.
    His early years Yeats spent in London and Sligo,
    a beautiful county on the west coast of Ireland,
    where his mother
    had grown and which he later depicted
    in his poems. <cite>Work cited</cite> <a href="http://www.famouspoetsandpoems.com">WWW.famouspoetsandpoems.com</a>
