I learned that web development is a lot of trial and error. Its learning to stop and take a break every now and then when working on a problem. I learned that Git Version control was very helpful for checking your work and improving it.

I learned That web design is about the bigger picture and not just the details. That if a client has a vision, its about the whole vision not just the details.

My main struggle with this final was coming up with something new. However I really wanted to make my own Photography website or at least get a basic one started. I learned in this course that knowing what you want is the hard part not getting it. I think that is what art is to me. A struggle to always seek.
