Frist Google I use everyday for looking stuff up and then then email would be another form that I use a lot for school and work.

Web browser, email, Amazon one-click aka shopping, internet survey and timesheets.

A lot of my work is me picking up the textbook then going back to the computer
the picking back up the textbook. I find it very helpful as a resource.
