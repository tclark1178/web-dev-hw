  <p>standard duct tape wallet with 2 pockets for cards. this takes about 30 minutes to make. i like it because you can customize to exactly the size you want.

the main trick to making a nice duct tape wallet that lasts a long time is to clean up the seams and edges - you don't want the edge of a strip of tape at the edge of the wallet, it will fray and the glue will get on your pants. i've pointed out all the places where we add an extra strip of tape to clean up an edge or seam.

oh, the other important thing is to use good quality tape. cheap tape disintegrates and the glue melts and gets all over. this is my third wallet - the first one fell apart after 6 months with crappy tape, the second one lasted over 2 years from good tape.

tape options: you can use good quality duct tape, gaffers tape, or reinforced packing tape. other types may work also.</p>

        <p>this pocket will hold lots of cards. follow the photo-notes on each photo.</p>
        <h1>Step 4: Add Second Pocket</h1>

        <p>this pocket will hold a couple cards for fast access</p>
