For working with Html is easy now but at first it did take some time to learn. I still find myself looking up
things I thought I knew. For now forms and att elements are still hard to learn.

I'm very anxious to learn CSS as it improves the look of html. Right now when I only code in html my websites look like 1990,
so CSS does improv that thank God!

I remember growing up making duct tape wallets so when I saw it assignment on how to make something I couldn't resist. I used Dan's
website as I didn't have enough time to get all my own stuff and pictures.
