my client was a Missoula art critic needing a website for his business.

display inline does not follow the width and height set but display-inline-block does follow width and height and allows side by side elements as display-block takes the full width of a container in a script. 

This project was a little hard as I kept having problems with the browser I think in displaying my content.
