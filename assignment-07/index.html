<h2>Lyrics</h2>

<div id="lyrics" class="container lyrics">
<p>
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah<br />
They tell me you've touched the face of God<br />
At the sound of the rope cracking on your neck<br />
They tell me you'd never give it up<br />
Like the song that was soul singing in your head<br />
So, honey, please, don't let go<br />
Or you'll fall into the dead of night<br />
So, honey, please, don't let go<br />
You better learn to fly<br />
'Cause they're gonna point you up at the sky<br />
</p>

The more that you want it<br />
The more that you need it<br />
I know that you'll be by my side<br />
In the heat of the moment<br />
When the thunder and lightning come<br />
I know that you'll be by my side<br />

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah<br />

That loving man ain't no rolling stone<br />
At the sound of the drums, I'm gonna set you free<br />
I talk to him on the telephone<br />
And these are the words that he gave to me<br />

So, honey, please, don't let go<br />
Or you'll fall into the dead of night<br />
So, honey, please, don't let go<br />
You better learn to fly<br />
'Cause they're gonna point you up at the sky<br />

The more that you want it<br />
The more that you need it<br />
I know that you'll be by my side<br />
In the heat of the moment<br />
When the thunder and lightning come<br />
I know that you'll be by my side<br />

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah<br />
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah<br />

And the more that you want it<br />
The more that you need it<br />
I know that you'll be by my side<br />
In the heat of the moment<br />
When the thunder and lightning come<br />
I know that you'll be by my side<br />
And the more that you want it<br />
The more that you need it<br />
I know that you'll be by my side<br />
In the heat of the moment<br />
When the thunder and lightning come<br />
I know that you'll be by my side<br />
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
