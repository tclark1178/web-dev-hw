<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<div id="lyrics" class="container lyrics">
<p>Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

They tell me you've touched the face of God
At the sound of the rope cracking on your neck
They tell me you'd never give it up
Like the song that was soul singing in your head

So, honey, please, don't let go
Or you'll fall into the dead of night
So, honey, please, don't let go
You better learn to fly
'Cause they're gonna point you up at the sky

The more that you want it
The more that you need it
I know that you'll be by my side
In the heat of the moment
When the thunder and lightning come
I know that you'll be by my side

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

That loving man ain't no rolling stone
At the sound of the drums, I'm gonna set you free
I talk to him on the telephone
And these are the words that he gave to me

So, honey, please, don't let go
Or you'll fall into the dead of night
So, honey, please, don't let go
You better learn to fly
'Cause they're gonna point you up at the sky

The more that you want it
The more that you need it
I know that you'll be by my side
In the heat of the moment
When the thunder and lightning come
I know that you'll be by my side

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

And the more that you want it
The more that you need it
I know that you'll be by my side
In the heat of the moment
When the thunder and lightning come
I know that you'll be by my side

And the more that you want it
The more that you need it
I know that you'll be by my side
In the heat of the moment
When the thunder and lightning come
I know that you'll be by my side

Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah</p>
